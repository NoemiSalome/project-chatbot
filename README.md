# Bootcamp-Project #03: Chat Bot
This project was realized in a pair programming setup. It was about the fundamental syntax and concepts fo JavaScript. The task was to build a Chat Bot, which interacts with the user depending on their answers. 

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- user interaction using JavaScript (focus on variables, data types, conditionals, functions)
- pair programming (discussing code, navigating, planning & structuring the project)
- looking for answers for a specific problem online and apply them in our own project
