# Bootcamp-Project #03: Chat Bot
This project was realized in a pair programming setup. It was about the fundamental syntax and concepts fo JavaScript. The task was to build a Chat Bot, which interacts with the user depending on their answers. 

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- user interaction using JavaScript (focus on variables, data types, conditionals, functions)
- pair programming (discussing code, navigating, planning & structuring the project)
- looking for answers for a specific problem online and apply them in our own project

The first step was about understanding the given code and how it works. After being able to respond with the users name we started to inspect other chatbots to see how they are set up and to understand the concept of JS better. Our first approach was to collect answers to three different questions and then put the answers in if statements, which we couldn't make work. So we took a step back and made the if statements after each question. Which made the flow of the code easier to grasp.
During the coding process we followed the given iteration and checked after each interaction if it was working like we expected it to. We got great help on Stackoverflow, Slack and from combing through google.
