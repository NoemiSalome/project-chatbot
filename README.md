# Chat Bot
This project, which was realized in a pair programming setup, was about the fundamental syntax and concepts fo JavaScript. The task was to build a Chat Bot, which in our case, tells the user where to go on vacation based on the users answers to questions.

## The problem
The first step was about understanding the given code and how it functions. After being able to respond with the users name we started to inspect other chatbots and see how they are set up to understand the concept of JS better. 
Then our first approach was to collect answers to three different questions and put all those answers in one if, else if, else statement, which we couldn't figure out how to make it work. So we took a step back and made the if, else if, else statements after each question. 

If we had more time we would have worked on the cold-, warm-button and make them disappear after clicking. We couldn't figure that out. So now it stays until the next buttons appear.
